# Codehub-Pfizer-Sacchon
A Diabetes Management Web Application, that has  an information system which contains: 1. A User Interface to submit and view medical data by the patients and doctors. 2. An Administration Console with user management, monitoring, and reporting capabilities of the system usage.
To test the project you need a database named Sacchon(I used Microsoft management studio), run the backend as a maven-java project(we used intelij, run Sacchon main), run the frontend as angular app(I used git bash right click on thos folder and write ng serve)
